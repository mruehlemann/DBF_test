# DBF_test

This repository holds the R code orignally hosted by Giovanni Montana on https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/∼gmontana/software/dbf/dbf_test.R, written by Christopher Minas, accompanying the publication [Distance‐based analysis of variance: Approximate inference](https://doi.org/10.1002/sam.11227) (Minas and Montana, 2014). 

This is *not* my code and only hosted here because the orignial website is no longer active and I found not other repository by the authors hosting the code and I used this code in my publication "[Application of the distance-based F test in an mGWAS investigating β diversity of intestinal microbiota identifies variants in SLC9A8 (NHE8) and 3 other loci](https://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2017.1356979)".
